NOTE: schematic.js editor is referred to as schem.js 


* Testing schematic.js

The idea is to check the results from schem.js against ngspice, a
free and opensource circuit simulator available through many linux
package management systems.

** Strategy
*** Tools
**** $ ngspice -v
ngspice compiled from ngspice revision 30

*** Use schem.js to create tests
output (schematic circuit netlist format, schematic.js results)

*** Existing code
**** parsing code
***** https://github.com/fahimkhan/Online-NgSpice-Simulator/issues/3

***** https://pypi.org/project/PySpice/ 
"PySpice implements a Ngspice binding and provides an oriented object
API on top of SPICE, the simulation output is converted to Numpy
arrays for convenience."

****** installing
$ pip3 install pyspice

In [5]: PySpice.show_version()
PySpice Version 1.3.2

*** UPDATE CANCEL THIS - Reuse the tests that ngspice uses.  
- this isn't going to work.

- translate the *.cir netlist format to the schematic.js json netlist format
- schematic.js has a json netlist loader, use that. 
- run the ngspice analysis for testN.cir
- determine the format of the ngspice output
- run the schematic.js analysis for testN and output to ngspice output
- diff the two outputs
- Run the tests in node.

**** get the tests
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/ngspice/ngspice
